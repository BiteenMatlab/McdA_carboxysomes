# McdA_Carboxysomes

Data analysis scripts used in Azaldegui et al 2026 "The kinetics and mobility of McdA drive carboxysome distribution in Halothiobacillus neapolitanus"

Scripts are organized into subdirectories corresponding to the type of analysis performed:
- biochem_analysis - calculating ATP turnover rate, ATPase specific activity, plotting specific activity, fluorescence polarization, size exclusion chromatography
- bulk_imaging_analysis - image registration, cell segmentation, carboxysome detection, nucleoid morphology, kymographs, spydeymaps, plotting scripts
- copy_number_analysis - image beam normalization, intensity trace collection, intensity trace analysis, single-cell intensity analysis, plotting scripts
- spt_diffusion_analysis - localization uncertainty, trajectory-based MSD analysis, radius of confinement analysis, step-based CPD analysis, VACF analysis, plotting scripts
- spt_dissociation_rate - track lifetime analysis, dissociation rate analysis, plotting scripts
